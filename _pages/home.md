Welcome to my Homepage!


I'm a 3rd year CSE major at [POSTECH](http://postech.ac.kr/eng/).\
Currently an undergraduate research fellow at the [Software Verification Lab](http://sevlab.postech.ac.kr/home/)

It's powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io)
