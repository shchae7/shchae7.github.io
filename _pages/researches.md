* Comparing DNN Verification Techniques and Approaches
  * Research Project I (Software Verification Lab) & Software Verification Lab Research Fellowship Research
  * Duration: 11.2020 ~ 02.2021
  * Topic: DNN Verification Approaches
  * Details: Researched different DNN verification methods (Reluplex, Marabou, DeepPoly, Neurify, ImageStar) and compared them based on utilized analysis approaches (Reachability, Optimization, Search), completeness, soundness, and system/property constraints.

* DNN Verification using Combination of SMT and Abstract Transformers
  * Software Verification Lab Research Fellowship Research
  * Duration: 06.2020 ~ 10.2020
  * Topic: Satisfiability Module Theories, Abstract Domain, First-Order Logic
  * Details: Researched a DNN verification method through the combination of SMT and abstract domain/interpreter. And through that methond verifying robustness of FCNN, CNN architectures.

* Modeling and Validation of Raft Using Maude
  * Software Verification Lab Research Fellowship Research
  * Duration: 12.2019 ~ 02.2020
  * Topic: Rewriting Logic, Model Checking, Maude
  * Details: Modeled Raft, a consensus algorithm using Maude. Verified Raft algorithm properties, 'election safety', 'log matching', and 'state machine safety'.

* Handwritten Math Formula Recognition
  * CSED441 'Introduction to Computer Vision' Term Project
  * Duration: 09.2019 ~ 12.2019
  * Topic: Optical Character Recognition, Image-to-Markup
  * Details: Applied pre-existing methods designed for printed text recognition to handwritten math formula recognition. Specifically based on a model from the paper ['What You Get Is What You See: A Visual Markup Decompiler'](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04938v1.pdf)
